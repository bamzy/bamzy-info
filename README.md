This is the code to my personal website. feel free to re-use, its going to grow over time,
currently these are the noticeable features:
* there is a webhook handler that authenticates github requests and in my case deploys the new code 
* it has an experimental jwt auth API system
* it has a text scraper that compares two prominent Iranian news sites and draws word clouds based on most frequent words used
